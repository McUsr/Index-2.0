Index-2.0
=========

David A. Curry's index, now for Utf-8 and local collation order, for Mac Os X, but portable. Uses ICU.

This is the rather premature "dump" of Index 2.0.

It is built by a makefile, and for the moment it is assumed that you are using Mac OS X Leopard or
later.

You'll have to go through the makefile and adjust things, as well as download the ncurses library.
You can use a stand alone ICU library, but I have chosen to use the ICU that ships with Mac Os X,
hence the limitation to Mac Os X Leopard and newer.

It builds with both i386, and X86_64 Architecture. And it runs too.

The installation, is totally manual at the moment. be sure to read the manual file that resides in the 
man1 folder.

Enoy.
