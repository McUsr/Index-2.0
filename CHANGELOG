2013-03-04 : cleaning up the build system preparing for autotools
			Makefile moved into Devel folder together with other tools.
			If you want to develop and use my makefile, then see to that
			you have a clean project by having run the appropriate "clean"
			command to remove the autotool configuration, make files etc,
			and link the Makefile in the Devel folder with:
			"ln -s Devel/Makefile Makefile", when you are standing in the 
			root of the project (right above the source folder).
