Index v. 2.0 How to port
========================

The ability to port Index v. 2.0 are being imporved upon as you read this.
Be sure to have the latest version from the github repo.

Hard coded Mac Os X specific values:
------------------------------------

All Mac Os X's ships with /usr/bin/nano, so that editor is invoked if there
is no editor to be found by the $EDITOR variable. You may wish to change this
should it be another editor that ships with your system all of the time.

Mac Os X specific stuff.
-----------------------

Mac Os X filenames are case insensitive, There are code in the select database
to provide for case insensitivity if your operating system uses a different convention.

Libraries
---------
As of today, I have leveraged upon the fact that Mac Os X ver. 10.5;
Leopard and later comes with the ICU library preinstalled, so I leverage
upon that. You will have to, now and for the future build the ICU library
yourself, and figure out how to link it. You may try to get help from
me with this matter thoug. And please push back any changes, so I can
make a branch for your platform!

I have used ICU ver. 49.1.2 for testing and development with it as
a static library, I am not sure if I then have used my own 14Mb data
directory, or the one that ships with Mac Os X. If you don't use Mac Os X,
then this data directory will have to be installed locally. There were
no problems using the ICU library as a static library, see the Makefile
for reminisces of it.

What you do need of the Ncurses library, should also be in the sourcetree,
when it comes to header files and libncurses.a. Should this turn out
to pose  a problem for you, then you must download a version of ncurses
and build it for yourself. I have used Ncurses ver. 5.9

Currently, I am also starting to implment GNU library to make porting
easier. When that is done, then GNU will also be needed for linking
statically, at this moment, an effort ahead of me is to make it compatible
with Autotools, and libtools so you should eventually be able to link
with GNU statically.


Enjoy!
