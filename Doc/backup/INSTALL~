Installation of index 2.0
=========================

This procedure pertains only to users of Mac Os X at the moment users from
other platforms will have difficulties to compile this initial release. It
also only works for those that can run an i386 program, which you probably
can if you have a newer Mac Os X, Leopard and onwards. I don't have access
to Mountain Lion, so I am not sure of the format of the ICU library that
ships with it, if you are having trouble, please don't hesitate.

We also don't use anything as fance as GNU autotools at the moment but
we are getting there!

Prerequisites:
--------------

I assume you are standing in the root directory of the expanded tarball
(project root).

This program installs by using make I assume you have GNU make install.

Check that by running ./make --version from a terminal window.

If you got it, then proceed:

cd to the directory of the tarball you have opened.


Figure out to which directory you want to install it. If you just want
to install it into this directory, then that is fine. Index will then
reside in the current directory after you have built it.


Building index:
---------------

type "./make install" and index should be built.

Should anything go wrong which you can't fix, then open an issue at gitHub

Running index:
--------------

First of all: read the man page.

type "man ./man1/index" for access to it from the project root in the
terminal window.

You'll find some sample files in the Samples folder, if you want to try
the program out as fast as possible then execute the following commands
from the terminal window.

cd Samples export INDEXDIR=`pwd` cd ..  ./index.

Please refer to the manpage for further configuration and installation
of index.

Installing index:
-----------------

Stand in the project root.

type "make install DESTDIR=/path/to/dir/over/the/bin/dir"

example: if you are to install in /opt/bin, then DESTDIR should be '/opt'
--> make install DESTDIR=/opt
--> the program should then be installed as /opt/local/bin/index, if you have sufficient rights.
The man file will be installed into /opt/local/man/man1/index.1 if you have the sufficent rights.

Are you making your own tree for storing binary stuff like this, then please remember to update
the manpath! See man man and man man.conf for instructions.

Enjoy!
