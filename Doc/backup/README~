README for Index:
=================

Index is a program I came by when reading Unix Power Tools at the library.

First of all, you shoul go into the folder "original" and read the README
file that is there I know this may seem like a lazy step, but the README
file of the original author David A. Curry says a lot about what index
is, and what it isns't.

I use it for collecting facts mainly, a task it is well suited for. It
is so fast to start a new semi or structured information collection
with index, that you later can open pretty sorted by subject into your
texteditor as a foundation for something else.

It also plays well with sed and awk, so there is no problems sifting
through it from Applescript, and open the result in TextEdit if one has
such needs.

The main difference between 2.0 and 1.0 is that it now handles unicode,
and reads and writes utf-8, besides sorting by collation order. Thanks
to IBM for their ICU library.  See NEWS for more details.

The Next step is to use GNU's library and the configure utility, to ease
porting to other platforms, and also provide a more granulated install
experience for Mac Os X, where you amongst other things can choose a
hardware archtiecture that suits you, as of today 2013.08.02 ony i386
is supported. Versions of Mac Os X older than Leopard will never be
supporoted. I'd love it if you fork this project, and push back a branch
for your operating system. The GNU lib and the implementation of the
autoconfiguration is right around the corner.
