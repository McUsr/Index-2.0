This is index, Version 1.0.

Index allows you to maintain multiple databases of textual information,
each with a different format.  With each database, index allows you to:
	- add entries
	- delete entries
	- edit existing entries
	- search for entries using full regular expressions
	- control what parts of an entry are searched
	- print out entries matching a pattern
	- run all or part of the database through an arbitrary
	  formatting program

The databases index maintains are stored as simple lines of text.  Each
field of an entry is a line of text, and each entry in the database is
made up of a fixed number of lines.  For each database, you tell index
what each field's (line's) name is.  You can have multiple-line fields by
leaving that field's name blank.  There's no fancy storage algorithm,
things are just stored sequentially.  But for the biggest database I've
got, about 500 5-line entries, performance is just fine.
